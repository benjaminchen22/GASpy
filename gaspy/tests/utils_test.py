    Recursive function that checks if there is any object type inside any branch
    of a dictionary. It does so by performing an `assert` check on every single
    value in the dictionary. Note that we could use EAFP instead of if/then checking,
    but that ended up being very illegible.

    Args:
        type_   An object type (e.g, int, float, str, etc) that you want to look for
        dict_   A dictionary that you want to parse. Can really be any object with
                the `items` method.
